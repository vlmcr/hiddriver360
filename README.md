# HidDriver 360
Experimental on-console HID driver focussing on providing third party, non xinput controller support to the xbox 360 without dongles.

## What works
- Supports both 17559 retail and 17489 devkit dashboards
- Reading controller input via USB
- Up to 4 concurrent controllers, in combination with original xbox 360 controllers or without them
- Controllers are registered inside xam and therefore fully recognized in the entire xbox 360 user interface, ring of light will update accordingly, no original controllers are needed etc
- The controller works in all tested games

## Current limitations
- no rumble support

## Supported controllers
- DualShock 4 (PS4 controller)
- DualShock 4 Wireless Adapter (CUH-ZWA1E)
- DualSense (PS5 controller)
- DualSense Edge
- DualSense / DualSense Edge optional tilt steering, Gran Turismo style (touchpad click toggles it, lightbar red/blue) — see [DUALSENSE_GYRO.md](DUALSENSE_GYRO.md)
- DualShock 3
- Nintendo Switch Pro controller
- Any USB HID compliant controller thanks to built in mapping assistant :) (this excludes modern xbox controllers like xbox one and xbox series because microsoft made them GIP only)

## How to use
1. load plugin (either at runtime or at boot via your launch.ini)
2. Connect controllers via USB
3. Controllers with a built in mapping will start working right away, for all other controllers that are USB HID compliant a mapping assistant will be started that guides you through the process of mapping your controller
4. enjoy :)

## How to build
1. Acquire the official Xbox 360 SDK using black magic
2. Install visual studio 2010 ultimate and visual studio 2019
3. Install the sdk using the "FULL" preset
4. Open the solution in visual studio 2019 and build
5. Hopefully enjoy :)
